# Installation Requirements

You will need to have a working installation of 
[Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/) environment to run
the AMS Hardware Suite.  Installation of some or all software may require
administrative access.

It is recommended that `python` be added to the `PATH` and that `*.py`
extensions are associated with `python`.

# Installation Instructions

To install, simply `pip install subdue`.  Note that there are several
external dependencies.  See the documentation for details.

## Examples

Several examples are provided for your convenience within the 
`examples_vX.X.X.zip`.  In most installations, simply double-clicking
on the file will execute the example test.
